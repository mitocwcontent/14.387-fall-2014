Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _14.387 Applied Econometrics: Mostly Harmless Big Data_ as it was taught by Prof. Joshua Angrist and Prof. Victor Chernozhukov in Fall 2014.

This course covers empirical strategies for applied micro research questions. Topics include:

*   regression and matching
*   instrumental variables
*   differences-in-differences
*   regression discontinuity designs
*   standard errors
*   analysis of high-dimensional data sets a.k.a. “Big Data”

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Understand empirical strategies for applied micro research questions
*   Engage in discussion about these strategies
*   Apply understanding in solving problems 

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Mostly my audience is headed for careers in research - either in academia, government, or NGOs. There’s also a growing private-sector contingent, people headed for jobs at places like Google, Microsoft Research, and Amazon.

Instructor Insights
-------------------

_In the column, “_[_Mastering Metrics: Teaching Econometrics_](http://www.voxeu.org/article/mastering-metrics-teaching-econometrics)_,” Prof. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke wrote about the need to "overhaul" econometrics pedagogy. Below, Prof. Angrist shares aspects of his pedagogical practice in 14.387 Applied Econometric: Mostly Harmless Big Data._ 

We try to keep the content real by using authentic empirical questions that can be answered with real data. We think logically, not abstractly.

_14.387 Applied Econometrics: Mostly Harmless Big Data_ is a graduate-level course. Although many students come wanting to just "sit in," all students are given name cards and required to participate in discussions. We also give long challenging problems sets - good performers earn prizes and recognition by completing these problems.

Assessment
----------

The course features three graded problem sets, which had to be submitted on time to be graded for credit. The course is graded pass/fail.

Student Information
-------------------

![37 students took this class when it was offered in Fall 2014.]({{< resource_file 99284ba8-7083-ab34-d31f-b108a07a0dcd >}})

### Typical Student Background

Most students were from Ph.D. or professional schools (like the Harvard Kennedy School). We typically get some precocious research assistants. Most of JPAL's ([Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/)) local full-timers seem now to take the course. SEII ([School of Effectiveness & Inequality Initiative](http://seii.mit.edu/about/)) full-timers also take the course. 

Many students have read at least some of the Angrist and Pischke book(s). These provide a good screen. If you like that stuff, and find it accessible and relevant, you'll like the course.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class/Lecture
----------------

Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session.

In addition, several recitation sessions were held throughout the year; these were facilitated by a teaching assistant.

The course was co-taught by two instructors, Prof. Josh Angrist taught topics I-VII and Prof. Victor Chernozhukov started teaching from topic VIII.

Out of Class
------------

Students spent time outside of class working on three graded problem sets as well as the readings.
